# Hello!
This is me messing around with the plugin system.
The aim is to make running party drinking games nice and easy.
It's based on the Dalamud Sample Plugin.

**Use at your own risk!**
This plugin isn't well-tested or particularly well written.
Only add the release to your Dalamud experimental settings if you know what you're getting yourself in to.

**Future refinements**
Saving/loading games as JSON to share with your friends.
More types of game.
Tracery grammar support.
RPG dice rolls, maybe - these likely won't be verifiable.
